# SearchEngine

In this project, I created a simple Search Engine using Page Rank Algorithm. The algorithm worked as follows:

-The program takes a search query entered from the user and checks for: Quotation Marks, OR keyword and AND keyword

-The program searches for the page based on its Rank which is calculated based on the Page Rank and the Click-Through-Rate (CTR)

-The connections between pages are represented as a graph
